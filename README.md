Q. What is Ansible?

Ansible is an IT automation tool.It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate 
more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime 
rolling updates.

Ansible was developed by Michael DeHaan and acquired by Red Hat in 2015.

The other tools which are similar to ANSIBLE are chef, puppet, salt etc. The thing 
that makes ansible different from others is ANSIBLE is an agent less tool, which 
does not required any special agent to be installed and running on client sides. 

Ansible is installed and configured on LINUX and it is used as central control 
station or master node.
